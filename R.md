The driving school management system project is developed in visual basic as front end and ms access as back end. 
This project is developed to manage the applicants details of both two-wheeler(mcwg) and four-wheeler(lmv). 
The 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler applicant details are added separately and user can search or modify the record whenever they desire 
by logging in with the correct username and password which they have given during registration. 
If they provide incorrect password they will not be able to search records .This project has an  admin login system. 
The administrator will enter the username and password to login to the system. If  the username and password are correct, 
it will open the next form. If the entered details are not correct, it will show the error message. 
The administrator’s purpose is to delete records  by entering the customer’s name , deleting records as they may have to 
remove data where the customer would have completed the course or have withdrawn. 
The delete admin-interface is separate for 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler.If record exists, the record will be deleted else it will display error 
message. The home page will also lead to forms wherein we can view about the driving school’s main motto and the driving school’s contact 
details and address .
